# P4.9
# Write a program that reads a word and prints the word in reverse.
# For example, if the user provides the input "Harry",
# the program prints
# yrraH


# P4.12
# Write a program that reads a word and prints all substrings, sorted by length.
# For example, if the user provides the input "rum",
# the program prints
# r
# u
# m
# ru
# um
# rum


# P4.15
# The Fibonacci numbers are defined by the sequence
# f1 = 1
# f2 = 1
# fn = fn−1 + fn−2
# Reformulate that as
# fold1 = 1
# fold2 = 1
# fnew = fold1 + fold2
# After that, discard fold2, which is no longer needed, and set fold2 to fold1 and fold1 to fnew.
# Repeat an appropriate number of times.
# Implement a program that prompts the user for an integer n and prints the nth Fibonacci number,
# using the above algorithm.



# P4.16
# Factoring of integers.
# Write a program that asks the user for an integer and
# then prints out all its factors.
# For example, when the user enters 150, the program should print
# 2
# 3
# 5
# 5



# P4.17
# Prime numbers.
# Write a program that prompts the user for an integer and
# then prints out all prime numbers up to that integer.
# For example, when the user enters 20, the program should print
#    2
#    3
#    5
#    7
#    11
#    13
#    17
#    19
# Recall that a number is a prime number if it is not divisible by any number except 1 and itself.
